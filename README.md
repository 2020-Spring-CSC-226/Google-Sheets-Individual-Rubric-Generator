# Google-Sheets-Grading-Script-Tool-Berea
This is the code for a Google Script tool written to be used with the grading system used by Berea College Computer Science Teaching Assistants and was written by TA William Romano. 

This is the script Will wrote that gathers student grade info and then appends them to the sheet in individual format. 

Instructions to Install:
1. Copy all of the code for whichever version you want to use. The first one places them all in vertical order. The second one places three in a horizontal row.
2. Open up the Tools tab and click on the Script editor button. 
3. Replace the given code with the code you copied and save the program. 
4. Now, refresh your Google Sheet and there should be a new tab at the top bar called Post to Moodle.
5. If you click on that tab, and click on the Format Individual Data option, a new screen will pop up, stating that it is an unsafe program and you need to authorize it. Click continue. You’ll choose the account you want to use, and then it will say that this app isn’t verified, that is fine. You will need to click advanced settings, located in the bottom left-hand corner of that window. There will be another option in the bottom that says Go to Script Name (unsafe), click on that and it will take you to a new page. On this page, click allow to allow your program to run this app. You will probably get an email about the authorization each time to have to complete step 5.
